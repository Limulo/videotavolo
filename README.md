# soundFace (a.k.a. videoTavolo)

_soundFace_ is an interactive musical surface by [limulo.net](http://www.limulo.net).

It has been developed with [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) (and the openFramework's addons _ofxTUIO_).

The main oF application:
1) works in conjunction with [reacTIVision](reactivision.sourceforge.net/) by [Martin Kaltenbrunner](http://modin.yuri.at/);
2) can be paired with some OSC-ready music software in order to create sounds;

## Compiling

In order to compile _soundFace_ from the source, you need to place the code inside the `app/myApp` subdirectory of your _openFrameworks_ folder.
For example, a suitable path to place the code would be:
```
/of_v0.9.8_linux64_release/app/myApp/sounface
```
